# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
This application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide a text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.  Description from the CWRU prompt. <br>

According to [mdn.com](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial), an SVG is an acronym for a Scalable Vector Graphic.  "It is a W3C XML dialect to mark up graphics."  If you, like myself, don't know what that means, it is a *World Wide Web Consortium* (W3C) dialect that uses the XML language.  The *XML* language is the *Extensible Markup Language*, which is similar to HTML except there are no predefined tags; you create your own tags for your own needs. <br> <br>
