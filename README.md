According to [mdn.com](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial), an SVG is an acronym for a Scalable Vector Graphic.  "It is a W3C XML dialect to mark up graphics."  If you, like myself, don't know what that means, it is a *World Wide Web Consortium* (W3C) dialect that uses the XML language.  The *XML* language is the *Extensible Markup Language*, which is similar to HTML except there are no predefined tags; you create your own tags for your own needs. <br>
